Investigated the downstream implications of reliability, exploring the relationship between reliability and judgment quality, and analyzing the impact of varying model settings on both judgment accuracy and reliability. Access our paper at this link for more details.\nDeveloped a suite of three metrics for evaluating topic model reliability, surpassing the standard practice method. Established a definitive, optimal metric, demonstrating its critical role in downstream applications. For more details, access our paper at this link.\n\n\n\n\nOverview : Developed a casually sufficient dimension reduction methodology for text data.\n\nCurrently, when topic models are used for further understanding of text, the topics that are generated are simply interpreted manually by the user and any outcomes predicted by the text are modeled by a regression. This new methodology provides a way to make interpretable causal conclusions about topics and their predicted outcomes through a dimension reduction process. No such methodology exists currently.\nIn additon, this methodology is useful in situations where text is the treatment, which is a complex and multifaceted scenario that is not handled well by existing methodologies."
